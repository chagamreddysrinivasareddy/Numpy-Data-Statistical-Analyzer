NumPy Data Analysis Report Tool


This project is a command-line based NumPy Data Analysis Tool that reads numerical data from a CSV file and generates a detailed statistical report. The tool processes the file line-by-line, converts data into NumPy arrays, and prints both overall and column-wise summaries.

It is designed for quick analysis of large numerical datasets using Python and NumPy.

Features :

✅ Validates input file existence
✅ Reads CSV file with comma-separated values
✅ Converts all values to numeric types
✅ Creates NumPy arrays from data
✅ Provides:

Shape of the dataset

Total number of elements

Overall statistical summary

Column-wise statistical summary

Requirements:

    Python 3.10.7

    NumPy

Install NumPy if not already installed:

    pip install numpy

How It Works :

    Checks whether the file exists.

    Reads file lines and splits values by commas.

    Converts data into numeric format.

    Creates NumPy arrays.

Generates:

    Dataset shape and size

    Overall statistics

    Per-column statistics
